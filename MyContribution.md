# My Contribution to the "Trolleybus Schedule" Project

As part of this project, I was primarily responsible for frontend development. This was my first practical experience working with Vue.js and a modern frontend stack.

## My Responsibilities

- Built the user interface using Vue.js
- Integrated key components such as schedule tables and dropdown selection
- Designed the initial layout and overall page structure
- Prepared the architecture for potential future integration of API-based map features
- Collaborated with the team via GitHub and practiced version control workflows

## Learning Goals

The aim of my work was to deepen my understanding of frontend development and improve my practical skills with Vue.js. Through this project, I learned how to manage UI logic more effectively and got familiar with a component-driven development approach.
